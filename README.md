# Free-space optical systems review

Free-space optical or wireless optical systems are typically communication devices capable of transmitting information between two points using modulated light sent through air and thus called free-space systems. There are a number of excellent articles, webpages and books outlined in the following section describing more about the technology itself.

This review is a live document collecting publicly available information about existing free-space optical products on the market to clerly evaluate their technical capabilities and empower the reader to make an educated choice in using these systems for their applications.

Everyone is kindly asked to contribute and provide better information to this review if available. Please use methods available via github.

## Free-space optical background reading
There is a reasonabely large number of free resources available online regarding wireless optical systems, providing generally available ones not associated with equipment manufacturers:
 * [Wikipedia Optical Wireless communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_wireless_communications)
 * [Wikipedia Free-space optical communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication)
 * [Book chapter: Free Space Optical Communications — Theory and Practices](http://www.intechopen.com/books/contemporary-issues-in-wireless-communications/free-space-optical-communications-theory-and-practices)
 * [Free-Space Optical Communications at JPL/NASA](http://opticalcomm.jpl.nasa.gov/PAPERS/REVIEW/overview.pdf)
 * [Review of free-space optical communications with diverging beam](http://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1570&context=etds)

## Wireless optical system review criterion
This review should list as many manufacturers and technical charasterictis of their products in an organized manner and collect publicised information about their systems and advertised affect of the free-space channel on the wireless optical link.
